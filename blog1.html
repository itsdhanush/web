<p>When it comes to how people deal with failure, perfectionism and high-achiever-ism go hand in hand. The objective of great success is to exceed a high standard that you have set for yourself. It's a test.


</p>
	    <span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of perfectionism is more similar to a survivalist mindset. If you mess up, you’re screwed, no matter what. Mix that with high achiever tendencies, and that shiny bar you’ve set for yourself becomes the standard for survival, whatever you’re trying to survive against. If you don’t hit that significantly above-average point, you’re so screwed. You’re meat. For whatever reason you’ve made up to justify that.</span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to confidently say that perfectionism is purely evil because I believe there are cases when it can do good. I’m also not implying “high-achieving good, perfectionism bad."</span>
	 <span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I think I’ll still fall back on perfectionist tendencies every so often, I’ve decided that I don’t want to grow up into the kind of person who uses perfectionism to dictate how they lead their lives—whether this is someone whose fear of failure holds them back from what they want to do, or someone who is as unnecessarily stern on the people around them as they are on themselves. I’ve been both kinds of people, and I don’t think either experience was worth it.</span>

<p>Perfectionism and high-achiever-ism go hand in hand whenever people discuss either of those topics, but there’s a distinct gap between the philosophies behind them when it comes to how someone confronts failure. The goal of high achievement is to reach a lofty bar that you set for yourself. It’s a challenge. font</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of perfectionism is more similar to a survivalist mindset. If you mess up, you’re screwed, no matter what. Mix that with high achiever tendencies, and that shiny bar you’ve set for yourself becomes the standard for survival, whatever you’re trying to survive against. If you don’t hit that significantly above-average point, you’re so screwed. You’re meat. For whatever reason you’ve made up to justify that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to say with confidence that perfectionism is purely evil, because I do believe there are cases when it can do good. I’m also not implying “high-achieving good, perfectionism bad.”</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-89924" src="https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-10-at-9.24.13-PM-400x394.png" alt="drawing3" width="500" height="493" srcset="https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-10-at-9.24.13-PM-400x394.png 400w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-10-at-9.24.13-PM-1000x985.png 1000w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-10-at-9.24.13-PM-800x788.png 800w, https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-10-at-9.24.13-PM.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I think I’ll still fall back on perfectionist tendencies every so often, I’ve decided that I don’t want to grow up into the kind of person who uses perfectionism to dictate how they lead their lives—whether this is someone whose fear of failure holds them back from what they want to do, or someone who is as unnecessarily stern on the people around them as they are on themselves. I’ve been both kinds of people, and I don’t think either experience was worth it.</span>
